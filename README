This program calculates properties of the charge mixture in an internal combusion
engine with indirect water injection.  It is currently in a very unpolished state and
should not be used for anything serious.

combustion engines: Analysis of the fresh mixture cooling effect" in International
Journal of Engine Research 2019, Vol 20(5) 527-539.
